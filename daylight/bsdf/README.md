We're keeping a backup here which is easier to access and download. Thanks @rpg777 for generating the files and NREL and OpenStudio for funding the project.

Wikipedia: [Bidirectional scattering distribution function (BSDF)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_scattering_distribution_function )
> The definition of the BSDF (bidirectional scattering distribution function) is not well standardized. The term was probably introduced in 1980 by Bartell, Dereniak, and Wolfe Most often it is used to name the general mathematical function which describes the way in which the light is scattered by a surface. However, in practice this phenomenon is usually split into the reflected and transmitted components, which are then treated separately as BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) and BTDF (bidirectional transmittance distribution function).
