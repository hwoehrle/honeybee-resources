# BSDF Glass Materials

These [BSDF]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_scattering_distribution_function ) materials are available on [Building Components Library website for download](https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/site/BSDF). BSDF is a general mathematical function which describes the way in which the light is scattered by a surface

We keep a fork here which is easier to access online and to download. Thanks [@rpg777]( https://github.com/rpg777 ) for generating the files and [NREL]( https://www.nrel.gov/ ) and [OpenStudio]( https://www.openstudio.net/ ) for funding the project.
