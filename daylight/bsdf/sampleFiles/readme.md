###BSDF sample files.   

This repository contains sample BSDF files. Details about the source of BSDFs is provided below:  
+ BCL: These BSDF materials are available on [Building Components Library website for download](https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/site/BSDF).
We're keeping a backup here which is easier to access and download. Thanks @rpg777 for generating the files and NREL and OpenStudio for funding the project.

+ TT: These BSDFs were generated by @zati89 for the purposes of the Transsolar Workshop held in August 2018. The files 
starting the b (i.e. b00.xml, b15.xml etc) were generated for a model with blinds only. The files starting with c (i.e.
c00.xml, c15.xml etc) include the glazing geometry as well as blinds geometry.
